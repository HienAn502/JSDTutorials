Implement a Java program that creates four tasks and four threads to run
them.
The first task is to print the letter F 50 times.
The second task prints the letter I 50 times.
The third task prints the letter T 50 times.
The fourth task prints the integers 1 through 100.
When you run this program, the three threads will share the CPU and take
turns printing letters and numbers on the console.
